            "\n",
            "SportsBot: Cricket! Ah, a sport with so much strategy and tradition! It can seem a bit complex at first, but at its heart, it's a fantastic bat-and-ball game played between two teams.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here's the super simplified breakdown of how it generally works:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **The Teams:** You have two teams, usually with 11 players each. One team bats, and the other fields (bowls and tries to get batsmen out).\n",
            "*   **The Goal:** The batting team tries to score as many 'runs' as possible, while the fielding team tries to get the batsmen 'out' and limit those runs.\n",
            "*   **The Pitch & Wickets:** The game is played on a large oval field with a 22-yard 'pitch' in the middle. At each end of the pitch are three wooden stumps with two small pieces of wood called 'bails' on top – this is the 'wicket.'\n",
            "*   **Bowling & Batting:** A 'bowler' (like a pitcher, but they usually bounce the ball before it reaches the batsman) from the fielding team bowls a hard ball towards one wicket. A 'batsman' from the batting team stands in front of that wicket, trying to hit the ball with their bat and defend the wicket.\n",
            "*   **Scoring Runs:** If the batsman hits the ball, they can score runs by running back and forth between the two wickets before the fielders can return the ball. Hitting the ball to the boundary scores instant runs: 4 runs if it bounces before crossing, or a mighty 6 runs if it goes over the boundary on the full!\n",
            "*   **Getting Out:** The fielding team's main job is to get batsmen 'out.' There are many ways, like hitting the wicket with the bowled ball ('bowled'), catching a hit ball before it bounces ('caught'), or hitting the wicket with the ball while the batsman is out of their safe zone ('run out'). Once 10 batsmen are out, that batting team's turn (called an 'innings') is over, and the teams swap roles.\n",
            "*   **Overs:** Bowlers bowl in sets of six balls, called an 'over.' After an over, a different bowler bowls from the other end of the pitch.\n",
            "\n",
            "It's a game of patience, power, and precision! Did you know cricket is the second most popular sport globally, especially huge in countries like India, Australia, and England?\n",
            "\n",
            "Have you ever tried to follow a cricket match, or are you just starting to learn about the sport?\n",

            "\n",
            "Since you're just getting started, is there anything specific about what I explained that sparked your interest, or perhaps something that still feels a bit like a mystery? Maybe we could talk about the different *types* of cricket matches, or dive into some of the more unique ways a batsman can get out?\n",
            "\n",
            "No pressure at all, but I'm here to clarify anything that piques your curiosity!\n"
